    "### Introduction\n",
    "<p>Nowadays, flying is one of the most popular and fast travelmodes. The number of estimated passengers in 2019 was 4.5 billion and this was an increasing trend (1). However, in 2019 the COVID19-virus started to settle down in the first countries. In 2020, it reached the Netherlands and everything changed. People got more or less locked up in their houses. We stopped meeting friends, going to work, etc. and we limited our movements to solely necessary ones. This was, of course, also the case for travelling. Going on holiday was not really an option anymore and so was flying to the other side of the world to meet family or friends.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The total timespan of the pandemic was about 3 years, however the impact of COVID19 on travel patterns was not equally the same over those years. In this project, we aim to find out how it impacted travel patterns by air at the major Dutch airports. We will not only consider passengers, but also the amount of cargo [tons] and mail [tons] and compare them. This brings us to the research question:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    ">*What is the impact of COVID19 on travel patterns for passengers-, cargo- and mail flights from Dutch airports to other regions in the world and the other way around between 2019 and 2023?*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope\n",
    "<p>To make this research question a bit more specific, the scope needs to be crearified more:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regions: EU countries (European Union), Other Europe, North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, South Africa, North America, Central America, South America, West Asia, South East Asia, North East Asia and Oceania.\n",
    "2. Dutch airports: Schiphol, Rotterdam The Hague Airport, Eindhoven Airport, Maastricht Aachen Airport and Groningen Airport.\n",
    "3. Baseline (pre-COVID) data: 2019\n",
    "4. Timespan of COVID19 in the Netherlands: march 2020 till january 2023 (2)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subquestions\n",
    "Finding the answer to the research question, it is necessary to take a look at the three different types of movements (passengers, cargo and mail) individually. For each type, data will be analysed and every subquestion will be researched and answered. For each subquestion, the movements to and from all regions and/or the arrival/departure rates of the movement types at the airports will be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. *What did flight patterns look like before the COVID19 pandemic started?*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2. *How did flight patterns change during the COVID19 pandemic?*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. *What do flight patterns look like nowadays?*\n",

There are some interesting points, for example the big drop in April 2020, on the graph that will be discussed in later chapters. However, it is very clear that by far most of the flights depart and arrive from Schiphol (red line). This portion is so big, that the other main airports in the Netherlands almost fall into insignificance. Also, the trendline of the total amount of flights of all airports together (blue line) corresponds neathly with Schiphol's trendline. Herefore, it is decided to continue researching only Schiphol Airport and leave the other airports out.</p>\n",
