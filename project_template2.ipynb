    "COVID-19 has had an influence on the number of passenger flights as well as cargo and mail flights. After the pandemic, the number of flights did not return to its initial numbers (2). This is because a lot of people discovered transport alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic (1). The goal of this research is to show the impact of COVID-19 on the number of flights from Dutch aiports. A time frame is used from 2019 till 2023. In this way it can be analyzed if the changes caused by COVID-19 continue in the upcoming years. "
